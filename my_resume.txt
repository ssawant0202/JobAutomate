API Automation (REST), CI/CD Pipelines, DB Validation (SQL), E2E & Shift-Left Testing, TestRail
Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) Jan 2024 - Jan 2025
New/Mode Vancouver, BC
• Designed and maintained scalable API and integration test frameworks in Python (Pytest) for RESTful services,
applying shift-left testing principles with fixtures, and layered assertions to validate authentication, error handling,
and edge cases, reducing regression escapes by 45%
• Implemented API automation with database-level validation using REST assertions and SQL queries to verify side
effects and transactional correctness, collaborating with backend engineers to identify inefficiencies that contributed to a
30% reduction in API latency
• Containerized test environments using Docker and Docker Compose, creating isolated, reproducible stacks for
microservices and databases, which reduced environment-related CI failures by 50% and improved local-to-CI parity
• Built and optimized CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions, integrating containerized test execution, regression gating,
and environment-specific configuration, preventing unstable merges and reducing deployment-blocking failures by 40%
• Modified and extended Bash scripts to automate test setup, configurations, and log collection within CI, while
documenting workflows and failure triage steps in Confluence, improving debugging and shortening release cycles by 30%
QA Automation Engineer Jan 2022 - Aug 2022
Faisal Labs Vancouver, BC
• Executed manual smoke, UAT, and regression testing by authoring structured test cases in TestRail and validating
end-to-end user workflows before each release, reducing production defects by 30% and enabling faster deployment approvals
• Developed automated end-to-end test suites using Cypress, implementing reusable selectors, fixtures, and environment-
specific configs, which reduced repetitive manual regression effort by 40% and improved test reliability across releases
• Performed backend data validation using SQL by writing JOIN-based queries and integrity checks to verify database
state after UI and API actions, identifying data inconsistencies early and lowering post-release data issues by 25%
• Executed performance and load testing on critical application flows using Apache JMeter, analyzing response times
and error rates to identify inefficiencies, leading to targeted fixes that improved system response times by 25%
• Authored and maintained test documentation in Confluence, including regression checklists, test plans, and
release validation procedures, improving cross-team clarity and reducing onboarding and handoff friction by 20%
PROJECTS
Smart Issue Tracker (Website)
• Built and deployed a production-grade issue tracking system using Next.js, Radix UI, and AWS RDS, implementing
Google OAuth authentication, role-based access control, and dynamic caching to improve request latency. Containerized
application and test infrastructure using Docker (separate dev/prod images, multi-stage builds) and orchestrated services
with Docker Compose for local and CI parity. Designed end-to-end API automation with pytest and integrated it
into a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, including database-level assertions and regression gating on every commit.
AI-Powered Test Failure Triage
• Integrated OpenAI API into a CI/CD workflow to assist in analyzing failed API and integration tests, generating
structured summaries and root-cause classifications from test logs. Implemented validation, timeouts, and fallback logic to
treat AI output as untrusted input, ensuring deterministic behavior in CI pipelines. Attached AI-generated insights
directly to the issue tracker to accelerate debugging and reduce mean time to resolution.
